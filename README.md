# COVID-19 Status Tracker

With the current pandemic that we are experiencing globally, I find it inconvenient to be updated about the status of the COVID-19 cases globally and locally here in MN where currently live. Social media info are sometimes inaccurate and others are bogus websites presenting nonsense information. So today, I have decided to create a simple app that gives me the core information in a glance without having to lurk the internet that works in both mobile and web browsers. The data used in the app are based on Minnesota Department of Health, CDC, US Covid Tracking.

The idea behind this app creation was inspired by the work created by Daryl Clari√±o here:  https://lnkd.in/ePb42Uu (Awesome job Daryl!)

I thought I'd share the app with you and hope you would find it helpful as well. Feel free to share it with your family and friends to keep everyone informed with the latest update on Corana virus. 

I'll keep adding more info to it whenever time permits. Here's the link:
